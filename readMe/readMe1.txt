When developing an extensive application, itâ€™s advisable to hook your project with watch parameters 
    that will help you restart your server whenever you make and save changes to your code structure.


(A)
ts-node-dev 
- it watches .ts files, and whenever you make a change, it will restart the server for you.
- npm install -D ts-node-dev            // -D ===> only dev dependency
- "scripts": {
      "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn ./src/index.ts"
   }


(B) nodemon
- node.js package used to watch .js files
